Two persistence options
    AOF: Append on File: logs every operation in a system file to rebuild data if restarted.
	file can grow big quickly but redis smartly using latest dataset shrinks the file size
    RDB: Redis Database (Default): takes snapshot periodically, based on time or number of items.

find snapping section in redis.conf
there will be some configurations like below
save 100 500


this means till 100 seconds if 500 records are affected, it will make a snapshot

AOF is find below be default its no
appenonly no

to start with configuration file
redis-server redis.conf

if you are using appendonly yes then it will createe appendonly.aof file at server start

you can copy redis.conf to redis2.conf to create different configuration and ports setting to 
use it as a replication server
change the port
then find slaveof <masterip> <masterport>

Redis persistence
You can learn how Redis persistence works on this page, however what is important to understand for a quick start is that by default, if you start Redis with the default configuration, Redis will spontaneously save the dataset only from time to time (for instance after at least five minutes if you have at least 100 changes in your data), so if you want your database to persist and be reloaded after a restart make sure to call the SAVE command manually every time you want to force a data set snapshot. Otherwise make sure to shutdown the database using the SHUTDOWN command:

$ redis-cli shutdown
This way Redis will make sure to save the data on disk before quitting. Reading the persistence page is strongly suggested in order to better understand how Redis persistence works.

changes while server is on 
CONFIG SET SAVE "60 1"

above config is already in config.conf file, but for this server start 60 1 will be used. once server restarts config value will be used

find below parameter in redis.conf to password protect
requirepass

now to enable slave to be able to connect to master use below
masterauth <yourpass>

now to connect with password protected server user below
redis-cli -a <yourpass>

--------------

set addr 500
get addr
incr addr
incrBy addr 100

same for decr and decrBy

getset firstName Amol
above command means get the existing value first and then set firstName to Amol

mset and mget
mset country India city mumbai state MH

so 
mget state country
will return 
MH 
India

exists country
return 1 as true

we can remove using below command
del country

expire zip 5

zip will be expired in 5 seconds
or
set zip 5 ex 10
zip wil expire in 10 seconds

lpush and r push are for lists

rpush fruits apple mango grapes
rpush fruits pine // will append
lpush fruits pear // will prepend

lrange fruits 0 -1 // shows all reecords

lpop fruits // remove 1 element from beginning
rpop fruits // from end

ltrim fruits 0 4 // means upto index 4

zadd rocker 1998 apollo 2008 liner // this is sorted set with info

flushall

TTL Foo
will give time left to expire foo value

persist greet
will persist and wil not expire if set to expire

append key1 " world"

we can rename the key1
rename key1 newkey1

linsert people before "Brad" "newname"

Disadvantages
    Increased network calls
    single latency microservice may impact overall system
    more moving parts in the system overall decreases reliability
    System can be partially up or down, is this okay?
Advantages
    lighter deployments
    fewer test scenarios
    programming lang/tools independence

Making the correct compromises in imp for success.

The cost associated with remote calls for most operations
in microservices architectures is often called the Distribution Tax

12-factor application?

It's not about size of the service, it's the operations of service that
should be thought about microservice.

Lets say search is down, but you can still watch movies.
balance between too granular or not granular enough is imp

The communication dance in microservices is primarily
 an effect of the ability of a service to call any other service

When a network failure happens, one can choose to guarantee consistency or availability:

High consistency comes at the cost of lower availability.
High availability comes at the cost of lower consistency.

Consistency in CAP is different than that of ACID. Consistency in CAP means having the most up-to-date information.

(ACID refers to a different database event. In ACID, consistency means any new transaction to the database wonâ€™t corrupt the database.)

ACID
    Atomicity
        either complete fully or not at all.
    Consistency
        Strong Consistency
            after the transaction is committed or rolled back, all the future transactions will see the effect of the transaction.
        Eventual Consistency
            in this model, reads might return a view of the system that is stale for some period but eventually will
            be reflect latest changes.
    Isolation
        runs parallel or serial, completely unaware of others
    Durability
        Any commited transaction is written to non-volatile storage. it will not be undone by a crash, powerloss, network issues.
